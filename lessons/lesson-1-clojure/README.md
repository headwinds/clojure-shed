# Lesson 1 Clojure

Learn how to make a few Clojure service calls and see how one can transform lists using map, filter, find, and reduce on the server.

see project.clj which lists them and their version numbers.

## Getting started

```
$ lein repl
$ user=> (require 'app.web)
$ user=> (def server (app.web/-main))
```     

## Reload the REPL

```
???
```      

## Deploy to Heroku

Copy this lesson into a new directory outside of this git repo so that it has it own git repo. We don't want to have nested repos.

This order is important:

```
heroku login
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
heroku create
git push heroku master
heroku ps:scale web=1
```
Then open your browser whatever url it created ie: https://glacial-badlands-20785.herokuapp.com/

## Sample Route Handler & Request

handler
```
(POST "/map-colonists-to-agency" request
  (let [agency-name (or  (get-in request [:params :name])
                    (get-in request [:body :name])
                    "SpaceX")]
```

Within this request, you can see the `:body` map which is a nested map with the `:name` property containing "NASA". If it failed to find the name, it would default to "SpaceX".

request
```
{
:ssl-client-cert nil,
:protocol HTTP/1.1,
:cookies {},
:remote-addr 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1,
:params {},
:flash nil,
:route-params {},

```
