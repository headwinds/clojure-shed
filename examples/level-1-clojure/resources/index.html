    <p>a simple experiment with Clojure, Compojure, Leiningen and Ring</p>

    Although <a href="https://shop.lego.com/en-CA/Lakeside-Lodge-31048">Lakeside Lodge</a>
      has the <span class="retired">Retired Product</span> tag, it can still be
      <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/LEGOÂ®-Creator-Lakeside-31048-Building/dp/B017B1BEBE">purchased on amazon</a> but this is a warning sign to snap it up quick before its gone.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some lego collectors see this Retired Product tag and think profit. There is <a href="https://community.brickpicker.com/blog/brickvesting/lego-set-retirement-keys-to-unlocking-secrets-of-eol/">aftermarket value</a> for rare and discontinued lego sets.
      Since these sets are comprised of mainly common pieces, they can be re-created by hunting for and assembling the pieces by simply staring at the box art. Builders can also fairly easily search for the instructions.
      But it could be even easier still if the file for each set carried everything a lego enthusiast desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      If lego was on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msZd8oNeI5k">blockchain</a>, it could provide a transaction history and carry all the blueprints.
      As the lego set <a href="/lego-blockchain">passed from owner to owner</a>, we would have an open record of its current state and it's histroy.
    </p>
    <p>If the lego set was ever opened, that state should be recorded on the block and it would be de-valued losing it's prized "Unopened" or "Mint Condition" status.
      But who is responsible for recording this act on the chain?</p>
    <p>I'll be using experiments like this to learn more about Clojure & ClojureScript as well as investigate how trust works on a blockchain involving real world goods and personal digital records.</p>
