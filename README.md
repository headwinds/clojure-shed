# clojure-shed
* explore a series of lessons that build up your Clojure & ClojureScript skills gradually
* the final lesson produces a simple API to store stuff securely using Clojure, Clojurescript, Leiningen, Crypto, and PostgreSQL deployed to Heroku
* geek out & fantasize about colonizing mars and decide what essentials we'd bring along on our trip

## Lessons

Complete 1/3

* lesson 1 Clojure - map, filter, find, reduce - [view online](https://glacial-badlands-20785.herokuapp.com/)
* lesson 2 Clojure PostgreSQL - 75% complete
* lesson 3 Clojure (with Crypto) PostgreSQL ClojureScript (with Reagent & Reframe) - 75% complete

## Requirements

- install [clojure](https://clojure.org/)     
- install [java](https://java.com/en/download/)      
- install [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)      

If you are on a Mac, it's best to install each with [brew](https://brew.sh/)     

- review my guide to [learning Clojure](https://github.com/headwinds/clojure-shed/tree/master/docs/learning_clojure.md)
- review my guide to [learning Clojurescript](https://github.com/headwinds/clojure-shed/tree/master/docs/learning_clojurescript.md)

## Deployment

Each lesson has its own readme.md on how to deploy to Heroku

#### Heroku

For more information about using Clojure on Heroku, see these Dev Center articles:

- [Getting Started with Clojure on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-clojure)
- [Clojure on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/clojure)

## Credit

I wanted to learn how to put together a Clojure & Clojurescript project so I basically started by dismantling [yogthos memory-lane](https://github.com/yogthos/memory-hole) to build this project.
