# clojure-shed
* explore a series of lessons that build up your Clojure & ClojureScript skills gradually
* the final lesson produces a simple API to store stuff securely using Clojure, Clojurescript, Leiningen, Crypto, and PostgreSQL deployed to Heroku
* geek out & fantasize about colonizing mars and decide what essentials we'd bring along on our trip
